## About the project

I've worked on this project to understand better about Context API, LocalStorage, request a server to check information.

For back-end I used JSON-server as a fake API.

This project is a challenge from RocketSeat course. In this challenge I had to make most of custom hook functions and turn static info on pages to dinamic with these custom hook info.

## Language
